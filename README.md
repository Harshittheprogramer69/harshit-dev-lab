# Programming & Computer Science Practice Repository

This repository is a curated collection of my programming work across multiple languages.
It represents my learning journey, problem-solving approach, and consistency in practicing
core computer science concepts.

The repository is intended to be viewed by:
- College faculty and mentors
- Peers and collaborators
- Recruiters or anyone interested in my technical skills

🧠 Development Practices

Clean and readable code

Logical structuring of programs

Use of comments where necessary to explain intent

Consistent file organization

Compiled files and system-specific artifacts are ignored using .gitignore

Only source code is tracked in this repository.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Demonstrate practical programming knowledge

Maintain a public record of learning and progress

Serve as a reference for revision and improvement

Showcase discipline, consistency, and technical growth

This repository is actively maintained and updated as I continue learning.

📌 Note

This is a learning-focused repository.
The emphasis is on understanding concepts deeply and writing correct, maintainable code
rather than on polished production projects.
